   This project is based on Django Framework 1.11, using celery to send email and ali-pay SDK to achieve payment. Anymore, this install tutorial uses Python3.6 and pip tool, the choice of IDE is PyCharm. You should complete it first.


## INSTALL PROCESS


1. install Django1.11, using:
```
pip3 install Django==1.11
```


2. create your Django project named sakacafe, using terminal:
```

```
* Or you could create the project using PyCharm directly.

* Both virtual environment and real environment is ok.

4. install requirements.txt, use command:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
* caution:Django Project is not worked in the virtual environment in my PC, so I used pipreqs to generate the requirements of current project. However, when I checked up the result, something goes wrong. Even I got it fixed but maybe some requirements is losted.It will be fixed when you use pip to install the third party library mentioned below.
